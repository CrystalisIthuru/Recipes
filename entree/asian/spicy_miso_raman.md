## Equipment
- Large Stock Pot or Dutch Oven

## Ingredients
- 8 oz. ground chicken or pork (sub crumbled tempeh or tofu)
- 2 Tbsp. neutral cooking oil
- 6 to 8 oz. thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms, stems removed
- 0.5 cup minced shallots
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger
- 3 Tbsp. white miso paste
- 2 Tbsp. lower-sodium soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp. rice vinegar
- 1 Tbsp. hot chili oil
- 6 cups low sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 packs dry ramen noodles (seasoning packs discarded)*
- 1 cup sweet corn (frozen/thawed, canned, or fresh)
- 3 soft-boiled eggs, halved*
- Thinly sliced green onions for garnish
- Toasted sesame seeds for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat a stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot, lightly grease and add chicken or pork (or vegetarian alternative). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, using a wooden spoon to break meat into small pieces. Transfer meat to a bowl and set aside.
2. Add oil to pan, along with mushrooms. Cook 5 minutes, until golden and tender. Stir in shallots, garlic, and ginger; cook 2 to 3 more minutes, until aromatic.Â 
3. Stir in miso paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and hot chili oil. Add broth and bring mixture to a boil. Lower heat and very gently simmer over medium-low for 20 minutes.
4. Bring broth back to a boil, and add noodles. Cook until noodles are al dente, about 3 minutes, or according to package instructions. Stir in cooked meat and corn.
5. Ladle ramen into bowls, and top each serving with 1 soft-boiled egg, a handful of green onions, and toasted sesame seeds. For more spice, drizzle extra chili oil overtop.

## Notes
- **Noodles**: You can use either fresh or dried ramen noodles. Alternatively, you can use soba (buckwheat) noodles or another gluten free variety, such as brown rice & millet ramen.
- **To make soft-boiled eggs**
    1. Let eggs come close to room temperature either by letting them sit on the counter for an hour, or running under warm water.
    2. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.
    3. Very delicately lower eggs into boiling water. Set the timer for 6 minutes.
    4. Remove eggs and plunge into an ice water bath. Gently peel off shells, slice the eggs in half, and place on top of ramen.
